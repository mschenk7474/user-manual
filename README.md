## What is Your Style?
- :bust_in_silhouette: Friendly
  - I am always willing to hang out with people. Friends make the world go round, and I am always trying to make new friends, no matter where I go. My social life is very important to me as well, and my friends contribute to that immensely.
- :notebook: Organized
  - I am a very organized person whether that be at work, school, or home. I have all of my homework on a to-do list with all my assignments and their due dates listed. I also have a to-do list for the day where I pull from the other to-do lists, such as the one I spoke of before, and others for work and my personal life.
- :construction_worker: Willing to Help
  - I always am willing to help others. I know how it feels to be stuck on something and have no one to turn to, so I am always available to talk things through. I may not know everything and may not be able to help you at the moment, but I am willing to listen to you and then get back to you with some researched help that I found from sources that I trust. 
## What do you Value?
- :family: My Family & Friends
  - My family and friends mean everything to me. Sometimes the two are mixed because friends can become family. I have lots of love for my family and the friends I consider family, and I would do anything for them. They mean the world to me, even if I don't mean it back to them. 
- :lotus_position_man: Personal Time
  - Personal time is a big one for me. I love being with friends and family, as stated above, but I do need my time. Whether that be just doing my homework alone, watching a tv show, or playing a video game, it doesn't matter. How I chose is up to how I am feeling in the moment and what will help me recharge from it all the best. I almost find it therapeutic to have that time to myself every day, wherever and whenever I can get it.  
- :church: My Religion
  - My religion is a big thing to me as well. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and I am very proud to say that. I believe in my religion to the point that I volunteered to be sent to a random place, out of my pocket, in the middle of a pandemic, to serve others and teach them about Jesus Christ. I did this because I want to share with others the way I feel and how the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints have impacted me, so maybe one day, they may feel the way I feel.
- :books: My Ability to Learn
  - I love learning. I feel like there are always opportunities to learn in life, you just have to be actively looking for them. If I am being honest, I am not always the best at taking advice or criticism from others, but I am actively working on fixing that. Learning comes in all shapes and sizes, and a day that you learn something is a day not wasted in my books. 
## When is the Best Time to Approach you?
- :construction_worker_man: Anytime, Except When I am Working
  - Unless I am working on something, feel free to come up to me! I get tunnel vision when I do my assignments, but at any other time, I am always up to talk. It doesn't matter what it may be about, I like to talk, share my interests, and make new friends where I can.
## How do you Like People to Communicate With you?
- :grin: In person
  - I am an in-person type of communicator first. I feel like people don't respond online unless 1) they are forced to for work/school or 2) they want to for a specific reason. When you are talking/communicating with someone in person, it is very easy to read them and get a conversation rather than doing it online and getting a response every hour or so. I rather start my relationships with people in person first and then move online. Then, I know how to reach them in person, and could also reach out to them online if I don't see them in person.
- :computer: Online
  - Now, I am not against communicating online. For some things, I would much rather communicate online, such as in department forums, or anything with lots of information. With it being online, most of the time all of the information is written down, so I can come back to it whenever I may need to use it or refer back to it. Online is also great to communicate with family and friends who may not live near you at the moment, and I am so happy we have technology that allows us to do that. I couldn't imagine not being able to speak with my family and friends, no matter where they may be in the world. It is also a good way to make new friends because everyone is connected through the internet. You just have to be brave enough to put yourself out there and make the friends you want. 
## How do you Make Decisions?
- :thinking: Think Through it
  - When making decisions, I like to think about some possible outcomes that might come from making the decision. I then will see what this decision is for, whether that be just for me, my family, etc. Then I will consider the overall impact of making this decision with what I am doing at the moment and decide whether or not to do it. I do not think this every time I make a decision, but I do make mental notes of what else I could be doing, who I am affecting in the process by doing this, and how it affects me in the process.
## What do People Misunderstand About me?
- :sunglasses: I am Both Introverted and Extroverted
  - As stated previously, I love being with people. People are amazing, but I also do love my personal time. To go off both of those statements, I would say I am extroverted, but need some introverted time to myself to be truly productive and recharge my social battery. 
- :policeman: I am not Intimidating
  - Sometimes when people look at me and see my shaved head and big frame, they don't approach me. I want everyone to know that I am very nice and that I am not intimidating. I am always willing to help others and be a friend to those in need. Just because I look a certain way doesn't mean I will act a certain way. Never judge a book by its cover. 
## How can People Help you?
- :speaking_head: Being Able to Talk Things Through
  - Whenever I need help, 90% of the time it can be solved if the person sitting there can just let me bounce ideas off of them. I have a million thoughts going through my head all of the time, so it is nice to talk with someone and articulate those thoughts into what I need to do next. That is why I have all my to-do lists and am very organized. If I wasn't, I would be a mess.

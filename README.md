## What is Your Style?
- :bust_in_silhouette: Friendly
  - I am always willing to hang out with people. Friends make the world go round, and I am always trying to make new friends, no matter where I go. My social life is very important to me as well, which friends contribute to immensely.
- :notebook: Organized
  - I am a very organzied person, at work, school, and at home. I have all of my homework in a to-do list with all my assignments and their due dates listed. I also have a to-do list for the day where I pull from the other to-do lists, such as the one I spoke of before, and others for work and my personal life.
- :construction_worker: Willing to Help
  - I always am willing to help others. I know how it feels to be stuck on something and have no one to turn to, so I am always available to talk things through. I may not know everything and may not be able to help you in the moment, but I am willing to listen to you and then get back to you with some researched help that I found from sources that I trust. 
## What do you Value?
- :family: My Family & Friends
  - My family and friends mean everything to me. Sometimes the two are mixed because friends can become family. I have lots of love for my family and to the friends I consider family, and I would do anything for them. They mean the world to me, even if I don't mean it back to them. 
- :lotus_position_man: Personal Time
  - Personal time is a big one for me. I love being with friends and family, as stated above, but I do need my me time. Whether that be just doing my homework alone, watching a tv show, or playing a video game, it doesn't really matter. It's up to how I am feeling in the moment and what will help me recharge from it all the best. I almost find it therapeutic to have that time to myself each and everyday, wherever and whenever I may have it.  
- :church: My Religion
  - My religion is a big thing to me as well. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and I am very proud to say that. I believe in my religion to the point that I volunteered to be sent to a random place, out of my own pocket, in the middle of a pandemic, to serve others and teach them about Jesus Christ. I did this because I want to share with others the way I feel and how the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints have impacted me, so maybe one day, they may feel they way I feel.
- :books: My Ability to Learn
  - I love learning. I feel like there are always opportunities to learn in life, you just have to be actively looking for them. If I am being honest, I am not always the best at taking advice or criticism from others, but I am actively working on fixing that. Learning comes in all shapes and sizes, and a day that you learn something is a day not wasted in my books. 
## When is the Best Time to Approach you?
- :construction_worker_man: Anytime, Except When I am Working
  - Unless I am working on something, feel free to come up to me! I get tunnel vision when I do my assisgnments, but any other time, I am always up to talk. It doesn't matter what it may be about, I like to talk, share my interests, and make new friends where I can.
## How do you Like People to Communicate With you?
- :grin: In-person
  - I am an in-person type of communicator first. I feel like people don't respond online unless 1) they are forced to for work/school or 2) they want to for a specific reason. When you are talking/communicating with someone in-person, it is very easy to read them and get conversation rather than doing it online and getting a resonse every hour or so. I rather start my relationships with people in-person first, and then move online. Then, I know how to reach them in person, and could also reach out to them online if I don't see them in-person.
- :computer: Online
  - Now, I am not against communicating online. For some things, I would much rather communicate online, such as department forums, or anything with lots of information. With it being online, most of the time all of the information is written down, so I can come back to it whenever I may need to use it or refer back to it. Online is also great to communicate with family and friends who may not live near you at the moment, and I am so happy we have technology that allows us to do that. I couldn't imagine not being able to speak with my family and friends, no matter where they may be in the world. It is also a good way to make new friends because everyone is connected through the internet. You just have to be brave enough to put yourself out there and make the friends you want.

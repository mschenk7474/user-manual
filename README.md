## What is Your Style?
- :bust_in_silhouette: Friendly
  - I am always willing to hang out with people. Friends make the world go round, and I am always trying to make new friends, no matter where I go. My social life is very important to me as well, which friends contribute to immensely.
- :notebook: Organized
  - I am a very organzied person, at work, school, and at home. I have all of my homework in a to-do list with all my assignments and their due dates listed. I also have a to-do list for the day where I pull from the other to-do lists, such as the one I spoke of before, and others for work and my personal life.
- :construction_worker: Willing to Help
  - I always am willing to help others. I know how it feels to be stuck on something and have no one to turn to, so I am always available to talk things through. I may not know everything and may not be able to help you in the moment, but I am willing to listen to you and then get back to you with some researched help that I found from sources that I trust. 
## What do you Value?
- :family: My Family & Friends
  - My family and friends mean everything to me. Sometimes the two are mixed because friends can become family. I have lots of love for my family and to the friends I consider family, and I would do anything for them. They mean the world to me, even if I don't mean it back to them. 
- :lotus_position_man: Personal Time
  - Personal time is a big one for me. I love being with friends and family, as stated above, but I do need my me time. Whether that be just doing my homework alone, watching a tv show, or playing a video game, it doesn't really matter. It's up to how I am feeling in the moment and what will help me recharge from it all the best. I almost find it therapeutic to have that time to myself each and everyday, wherever and whenever I may have it.  
- :church: My Religion
- :books: My Ability to Learn
## When is the Best Time to Approach you?
